# K-means algorithm with Python and matlab

* **Algorithm** K-means Algorithm

  ```c
  Randomly initialize K cluster centroids:
  Repeat{
      for i=1 tom m
          c^{i} : = index(from 1 to K) of cluster centroid closest to x^{i}
      for k=1 to K
          u_{k} := average(mean) of points assigned to cluster k
  }
  note: m is the number of samples
  ```
